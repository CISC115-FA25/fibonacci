# Fibonacci Number Example

Write a program that determines the nth Fibonacci number, given the first two numbers.

Input: first two Fibonacci numbers and the desired Fibonacci number
Output: nth Fibonacci number

## Algorithm
Get the first two Fibonacci numbers
Get the desired Fibonacci number
Get the position, n, of the number in the sequence
Calculate the next Fibonacci number 
Add the previous two elements of the sequence
Repeat Step 3 until the nth Fibonacci number is found
Output the nth Fibonacci number
